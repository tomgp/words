> I have very strong opinions about programming, but one rule I try to follow is _do not mock other programmers_. Programming is too big and I’m too small to understand everything. Disagreeing is fine, laying out why people are wrong is fine, making fun of them is not fine.

[Hillel Wayne]()

I have moderately strong opinions about programming and try to stick to this rule. I never really have anything public to say about other peoples code but when I come to a new codebase with which I'm unfamiliar it seems like good form to give the decisions made the benefit of the doubt. A kind of version of Chesterton's fence

> _In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it._

[GK Chesterton](https://www.chesterton.org/taking-a-fence-down/)

Plenty of times over my career I've been frustrated with existing code and undertaken a re-write. After a couple of weeks, once accounting for all the edge cases I didn't know about when I started off, I end up roughly where I started but two weeks later. This has happened even with code which I wrote originally.
