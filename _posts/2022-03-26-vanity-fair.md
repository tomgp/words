On the recomendation of [Stef](http://www.stefanieposavec.com/), at our work summer drinks a couple years back, I read Vanity Fair. It's taken me a while (started back in December) and I enjoyed it, but it's not one of those books that I'd wholeheartedly recomend to a modern reader; there are long passages comprising veiled caricatures of people of whom you've never heard, you're never very far away from some casual racism and Thackeray is, if not any more sexist than your average mid 19th century Londoner, not particularly capable when it comes to dealing with female characters. This is ironic as the book revolves around Becky Sharp who's an all time great character. I had thought of reading the book over the course of a couple of years, mimicking the original production schedule I might do that with some Charles Dickens at some point. But anyway, having read a reasonable amount now I'm begining to figure out where my tastes lie in terms of 19th century literature -- short version I like more of the social realism side of things. I feel like I might quite like Thomas Hardy who's Mayor of Casterbridge I hated and failed to finish as a GCSE English studying teen.

Also, I finished reading Terry Pratchett's Mort to K. Interesting to read an earlyish Discworld book, a real feeling of exploring a space that's unknown but full of promise. I feel like Mort is the point (4th in the series) where Pratchett starts to treat the Discworld books as an on-going thing, there's a bit more solididty to the world, it's becoming a bit more than just generic fantasty set dressing for some gags. Mort is one of the best ones, it moves at a fantastic pace and showcases Pratchett's skill at taking our naive intuitions about how the world works and pushing them to extremes for the sake of jokes and a gentle, never cynical, kind of satire.

Also, I quit my job.
