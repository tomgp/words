**Inifinte Jest – David Foster Wallace**

So this took me about 3 months. It’s not particularly a difficult read really, on a sentence by sentence level, but it does require some sustained attention – I’ve been cycling into work 90% of the time so my hour of commuter time reading hasn’t been there plus child care etc. A committed reader could do it in a month or two I expect.

Short version: It’s well worth your time, use two bookmarks.

\[there was more but my archiving didn't get it for some reason, the following bit added Jan 1st 2021\]

I don't regret reading this but I no longer think this book is necessarily worth your time. It is good, perhaps even great, but I don't think it has the property of expanding in your mind over the years that my favourite books do. For a similarly sizes ostentatiously GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL type tomes I'd promote Dos Passos underated USA Trilogy.
