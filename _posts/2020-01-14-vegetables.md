We've been getting vegetables from <a href="https://www.oddbox.co.uk">OddBox</a> for a couple of months now. It's good in terms of forcing us to cook more imaginatively instead of falling back on the same old 5 or 6 dishes with slight variations. Over the last few weeks we have become familiar with many many ways to prepare cabbages.

Planted some potatoes in the garden.

I took _Hearthstone_ off my iPad. I've played it a bit on our Windows PC but this requires a concious decision in a way that playing it on something portable doesn't (for a start it takes YEARS to boot up, I think because it doesn't have an SSD). Also, I can't play it when the keds are playing _Minecraft_/ watching videos of people playing _Minecraft_. As a result I've found myself less in that semi-present state where time just gets deleted whilst we stare at small screens and _Master Chef_ or _Tatoo Fixers_ or something else ignorable plays in the background.

The RSS feed for this site is a bit broken at the moment and I'm at a bit of a loss as to how to fix it (i.e. I can't summon the energy to try, hgace a feeling it has somehting to do with the mardown parsing or some wierd character escaping happening/ not happening). Sorry about that if you read the site that way -- I'll continue to turn the problem over in my head until a) I somehow magically know what the problem is and how to fix it or b) it fixes itself.
