I've been looking after the kids on half term this week. Which has been a joy but it's hard to resist frequent Minecraft breaks.

We went via a very long bus trip via Finsbury park, Stamford hill and Clapton to Museum of Childhood in Bethnal Green. I haven't been there since I was about 8. They still have the spooky victorian dolls house that I remember. They also have an XBox. It's one thing to see toys from my childhood, an entirely other to see a console I owned when I was well into my 20s. 

The mueseum though; it was fine. An interesting collection in a nice space. It lacked any particular point of view though other than here's some stuff. Neither the glorious high Victorian taxonomy of the NHMs mineral gallery nor any strong thematic structure and not much to add context either in the way that the best bits of the Science Museum do (Tim Hunkin's domestic appliances exhibits in the basement FWIW). It feels like it could do with a little love.
