Snowpiercer, unstructured thoughts.

Definitely Miévillian – I mean violent class struggle on a train.

Took me about 45 mins to realise the main guy was captain America.

Afterwards I went online and read what people thought and there was a whole lot about how the film’s last act was rendered incomprehensible because the Korean dialogue wasn’t subtitled which kind of opened my eyes to how cine-illiterate yr average Internet forum guy must be. No wonder people go crazy for those MCU films. SPOILERS: I mean even without the benefit of flashbacks it’s pretty damn obvious why you might want to blow a hole in the side of a train that you’ve been stuck on for 17years even if it means probable death, especially so if you happen to be chemically dependant and have spent a large chunk of those 17 yrs in a dark box like one of those ones they have in morgues (in American hospitals on the tele)

Sci-if sub genre wise it’s kind of a generation ship story. Particularly reminded of the central conflict in the Le Guin novella that closes her ‘birthday of the world’ collection i.e. Those who have developed a religion based on the perfection of the sealed ecology of the ship vs those who are like ‘sod it, just drop us off on the nearest thing with an atmosphere’

The fact of the train raised some interesting possibilities re the extent to which any individual might know their position in the train and by extension in the grand class scheme of things. Like how far the train extends back and forwards from a given passenger and the extent over which they’re able to range and the implications of this – does this reflect how class works, to what extent do we only encounter people in adjacent carriages? Etc.

Generally speaking the train/ class thing works really well; obviously a massive simplification but it has a way of not quite adding up in interesting ways.
