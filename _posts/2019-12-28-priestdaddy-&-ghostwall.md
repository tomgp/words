writing this in the github  file editor. expect typos ( or the swipe typing + autocorrect equivalent, the wrong word spelled  correctly , swipeos).

anyway. i really enjoyed Patricia Lockwood's  priestdaddy.  starts off a breezy comic memoir but more frequently as the book goes on it enters both darker and more luminous territory. i  laughed, i  cried!

 after that i  finally got round to reading a second sarah moss  book. i really enjoyed  her first, cold world,  nearly 10  years back.   in  the ghost wall she's  recognisably  the same writer but it's a  more confident dense book in spite of its tiny page count  something that opens up in your  brain  in the days after you finish.
