Just so we're clear, the thoughts, memories and opinions expressed here are temporary.

It seems I've settled into mainly writing about books I've read and some games and parenting stuff on the side.

If you subscribe to the blog via the RSS feed you'll probably receive multiple drafts of each post as I struggle with my inability to spell even the simplest of English words.

You can get in touch with me by email, that's probably easiest, though I can't promise I'll respond in a timely manner, sorry about that.
