### Transport

I don't know where I read it but the idea that we should judge a city not on whether poor people have cars but on whether rich people use public transport struck me as an good one.

### Undignified behaviour

We went ot visit some friends in Bath over the weekend (that place is _really_ playing up the Jane Austen angle these days). It was raining so we took the children to burn off some energy at a trampoline park at the local leisure center followed by some swimming which I sat out, opting instead to fall asleep on a tiny sofa in the foyer :shame-faced emoji:

### Lara Croft GO

Spent several hours on Sunday playing Lara Croft GO with the kids -- watching them take turns at the levels. It's a nice puzzle game. I expect we'll finish it in another couple of sittings though after a certain point we found that I had to solve the crux of the puzzle more often than not. as we progressed K&J developed a language for describing some of the common problem solving tools you deploy in the game e.g. the game is turn based so you move and then the game world advances one step -- [rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)) like -- they decided the process of advancing the game clock while returning to your avatar to her original position was called fiddle-fiddling so they'd be like "go over there, fiddle-fiddle the spider into position then flick the switch to drop the boulder". c.f. [last weeks comments about jargon](/words/2018/09/20/jargon.html#jargon).

### Read

Tonight I should finish Michael Pollan's book on the recent upsurge in research into LSD and psilosibin it made me want to get some magic mushrooms. I intend to write up books in their own posts, reprising the [write something about every book I read policy of 2014](http://blog.toffeemilkshake.co.uk/tagged/read+2014/), speaking of which:

### Archival

As I write these new posts once a week (so far my schedule is tied to when [Alice publishes her Weak Notes](http://alicebartlett.co.uk) I'll also be importing older writings from older blogs and other places where I've written stuff as part of general audit of my online presence these will appear on the [index](/words) and possibly in the RSS feed too.

### Hearthstone

I've been playing a rogue deck built around the new(ish) [Pogo-Hopper card](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/89844-pogo-hopper) it's fun to play though tricky to play right, my win rate's not much better than 50/50 but it's satisfying when it works as it can come as a bit of a surprise to your opponent. One reason for my affection is that it seems surprisingly effective against [taunt druid](https://www.metabomb.net/hearthstone/deck-guides/taunt-druid-deck-list-guide-hearthstone-9) a deck archetype which I hate with a passion; of my wins last night two were against this type.

### Worky stuff

Working in a small team I do miss the chat of other developers, the ability to sense check ideas widely, but it's also quite liberating to be away from what can often seem like groupthink -- no one here posts articles from Hacker News on the slack channel PRAISE THE LORD! Occasionally it's worth trying out stuff off the beaten path or back tracking; acknowledging that not all software is built for the same thing nor needs to be built to the same standards in all aspects or using the same processes. In the same way that we take for granted that the creation of physical artifacts will vary in these terms -- a hand made shoe is not the same as a bridge -- so we should for software artifacts.

### Closing quotation 

I did have a good quotation from Bertrand Russel to finish off this weeks post but I wrote it on a post it and left it at home
