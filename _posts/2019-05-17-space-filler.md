Long time no post. Still aiming for one a week.

I finished [the dinosaur book](https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/steve-brusatte/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-dinosaurs/9781509830091) I was reading. In spite of glowing reviews I found it  bit nothing. Possibly I'd been exposed to more of the content than most when I was working at the NHM but I don't think so, more that throughout the book the author seems to want to talk more about the personalities of paleontologists (or pale ontologists as the book regularly splits it across lines) than the work and techniques; on more than one occasion we hear about a technique or process and its like "it's boring so I'm not going to go into it" ... come on! I'm reading a 400 page book about dinosaurs, tell me!

What else? Oh yeah, finished reading the third Earthsea book to K. I don't remember getting to the end of it as a child -- though I did, when I re-read in my 30s I remembered the closing chapters. On this 3rd read through I was struck by a couple of things 1. it's the most standard high-fantasy narrative of the original trilogy 2. Le Guin is already trying to complicate the world giving different versions of events (see also this good essay about [historical revisionism in Earthsea](http://strangehorizons.com/non-fiction/articles/a-revisionist-history-of-earthsea/)) 3. The structure involves a long stretch of nothing in the middle which for K (and I guess me as a child) isn't that great, but reading as a grown up is a crystalisation of the latent taoism of the cycle and fore the more anthropological bent of Le Guins later fiction.

Also, played a print and play version of [escape from aliens in outer space](http://www.eftaios.com) with J. It was great fun and I look forward to playing it with a larger group of adults.
