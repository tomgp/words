title: Unsolicited advice
---

Generally I try to steer clear of giving people advice about software development, I mean, I've been doing it for a while (software development) and I'm not bad at it and all but a lot of what I've learned is that the answer to a whole bunch of questions is "it depends", so I'm wary of offering advice. Add to this the fact that I find it hard to tell whether something I think I've figured out is insightful or banal ("[the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance](http://bulletin-archive.kenyon.edu/x4280.html)") ... and whatever, a blog is the perfect place to mix banality and insight so I figure sometimes I'll write about worky stuff. So...

## Hidden requirements

I had lunch with my former FT colleague Anna last week and amongst other things we talked a bit about what I think of as hidden requirements. We used to talk a lot about these on newsroom projects at the FT but Anna and I had only overlapped in our tenures for a couple of months so she hadn't heard the idea. Basically in any project everyone will have a set of agreed requirements but often people will have other motivations for getting a piece of work done or for doing something in a particular way these are requirements that are usually hidden. Hidden requirements often include things like "I want to look good to my boss", "I want to try out this new technology to improve my CV", "I want to win some awards" and so on; these can be difficult to say out loud (for a variety of reasons as rich and varied as the people you have on your project) but I think uncovering them and getting agreement about their prioritization can really increase the chances of a projects success. For what it's worth most of the time I think these hidden requirements are valid -- it's absolutely fine to want to try out or learn a new technology, it's fine to want to win an award. The more insidious hidden requirements are those that come unspoken from above and it's up to the team to divine these in order for a project to be a success. What does management really want from this project and how can we make that work whilst not compromising the user needs -- surprisingly consistent.

## Hearthstone 'stoptober'

I deleted this from the iPad on Monday morning i was spending too much time on it... i enjoy it and it doesn't feel like a JRPG style time sink, theres no grinding or any of those time eating mechanics but I was spending about 45-90 mins on it a day and I figure I could use that time for something else for a month so that's that.

## Killing Eve

It's good isn't it? Cool sound track etc.

## The latest Star Trek film

I don't even know why I bothered with this. The thing that really strikes me about the recent crop of Star Trek films is how shallowly they're imagined. Like in even the most knockabout episodes of the TV show you feel like the writers have given _some_ thought to the society in which the action takes place and the societal implications of the technology etc. etc. things which are just totally absent from the reboot.
