It was Nick's birthday party on the weekend, went to a nice pub in Tunbridge Wells.  I drew a card of him as a Fire Emblem: Three Houses character which he posted on reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/e7tog2/my_friend_made_me_this_card_for_my_42nd_birthday/">internet fame at last</a>! I caught up with Nicks cousin who I hadn't seen for years. I got really drunk and worry I talked utter nonsense for much of the evening. Re-affirmed the dangers of drinking whiskey.

Gave a talk to ninety eight-year-olds about software development. They asked really good, astute questions (many were to do with Clash of Clans)
