It was Nick's birthday party on the weekend, went to a nice pub in Tunbridge Wells.  I drew a card of him as a Fire Emblem: Three Houses character which he posted on reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/e7tog2/my_friend_made_me_this_card_for_my_42nd_birthday/">internet fame at last</a>! I caught up with Nicks cousin who I hadn't seen for years. I got really drunk and worry I talked utter nonsense for much of the evening. Re-affirmed the dangers of drinking whiskey.

OK. Politics. I can't vote for Labour at the upcoming election. The antisemitism thing is undoubtedly overplayed in the media in comparison to how much time gets devoted to the abhorrent racism and bigotry of the Tory party. _BUT_ they've been fucking terrible at addressing it and listening to Corbyn on the subject it's obvious he just doesn't get it and if the person at the top doesn't get it no one else in the organisation has to get it. Why should I have to choose between the obviously and historically racist tory party and the also racist current incarnation of the Labour party? I refuse.

Watching people on twitter putting "antisemitic tropes" in scare quotes as if it's all a lot of fuss over nothing is genuinely awful. Can you imagine minimising the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypes_of_African_Americans">anti-black tropes</a> in this way? And this is a "principled socialism"? Bull Shit. I guess I'm lucky that I live in a safe Labour seat and my decision won't help put the Conservatives in government. I will as I often have be voting for the Green party. In the teeth of a world shattering climate crisis all other policies should be viewed through that lens, surely to do otherwise is folly?

Gave a talk to ninety eight-year-olds about software development. They all asked really good, astute questions (many were to do with Clash of Clans)
