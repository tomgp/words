**Ancillary Justice & Ancillary Sword – Ann Leckie**

Having finally got around to writing something down about these two Chrome crashed and I lost it.

So, short Version:

* Imperial Rome in space – I like stuff about Rome and I like space.
* The use of she/her for everyone in the book (male or female the Radsch culture doesn’t have that distinction) works very well indeed, a clear improvement on Le Guin’s flawed decision to stick with male pronouns in _Left Hand…_.
* The gender, colonialism, identity stuff is on the table and interesting enough but never gets in the way of space battles and assasination and so on.
* Seems like there’s still an awful lot of ground to cover in the final part which I’ll be buying in a couple of weeks when it comes out.
