Half term came and went; I took time off work and looked after K&J most of the week…  ice skating, a bike ride to the pump track at Lordship Rec and teaching them miniature painting were the highlights. J played a lot of Skyward Sword on the Wii; interesting to see it in the light of Breath of the Wild esp through the eyes of someone for whom BOTW is _the_ Zelda game.

I’m still enjoying  painting of Warhammer minis and feel like i’m improving, though there are still few major weaknesses — faces, metal, patience.
