title: Catacombs, Attenborough. (Cattenborough)

(posted over a month after I wrote it)

The kids and I played _Catacombs_ on Sunday whilst Emma when to the football, it's really fun game to play with kids (_Catacombs_ that is, I don't know about football, I'm a neglectful parent in the area of ball sports). This time I insisted we played by the rules which worked well. They're getting to the age where they can remember and understand the rules and also where following the rules adds to the excitement -- genuine peril -- rather than making it feel out of their control I still tend to play in the GM role as a facilitator rather than as an opponent as the spirit of the rules suggest.

We've been watching a bit of the new David Attenborough series and I concur with a lot of the criticisms I've read... The animals are anthropomorphized to an excessive degree and the real humans whos actions effect the creatures are never visible or available. The elephant in the room I guess if it weren't for the fact that there are actual elephants in the room.
