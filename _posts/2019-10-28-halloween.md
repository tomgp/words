I've gone on a bit of a halloween roller coaster over the last couple of years. I used to be indifferent, then there was the novelty and enjoyment of helping children dress up but now that's become a bit of a chore and frankly I could do without shepherding 6 or 7 excitable children around the dark streets of North London (_Motherland_ vibes).

Finished a couple of books that I don't have anything to say about. I've made some bad choices recently -- I haven't stayed true to my own predilections. Right now I'd prefer to read an interesting bad book than something blandly competent, October has been a month of bland competency (in terms of the books I've chosen to read, not in terms of our government natch).

I've had occasion to write some PHP recently. Whenever I type `<?php` I _ALWAYS_ sing ["PHP! A PC PHYRRIC VICTORY!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDMHvXJn0aM) to myself.

Picked up a new [Oink](https://oinkgms.com/en/) edition of Reiner Knizia's _Modern Art_. Played it a couple of times with the kids and once with the inlaws. It's GOOD! I'm a Knizia fan and I think this might be his best game. Why did I wait so long to get it?

__[The Rise of Conceptronica](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/2010s-rise-of-conceptronica-electronic-music/) -- Simon Reynolds__

A long piece looking at electronic music's turn towards the conceptual over the last decade. Whilst I'm into some of this stuff (_The Shape of Trance to Come_ by Lorenzo Senni is an all time fave) I think he nails the reasons why I don't really get on with a lot of it...

 >  These conceptual works rarely seemed like records to live alongside in a casual, repeat-play way. They were statements to encounter and assimilate, developments to keep abreast of. Their framing worked as a pitch to the browsing consumer, not so much to buy the release but to buy into it.

I guess this isn't music that's doing anything I care about qua music.

I love this review of John Updike's early books. I've known a couple of people who are major Updike fans but he never really appealed to me _BUT_ for all the trappings of a hatchet job this review might have convinced me to give him a go. Lockwood is funny and refreshingly even handed whilst not giving Updike any kind of pass. Also includes this killer DFW smackdown:

 > Wallace’s vivisection of Updike’s misogyny seems calm and cool and virtuous, and then you remember that to the best of anyone’s knowledge Updike never tried to push a woman out of a moving car

I think this is important stuff, reminding us of the complicated relationship between creators and their creations and how we all have to work with that on an ongoing basis. How many people would DFW have had to push out of moving vehicles for me to resolve not to finish that half read short story collection on my shelf? What would Eric Gill have to have done in order for the BBC to remove his statuary from the front of Broadcasting house? To stop using his famous typeface? Michael Jackson is still played, R Kelly is "cancelled". I guess being dead eases the ethical calculus.
