Famous web developer Jeremy Keith has posted [a good piece on the flawed nature of behavioural advertising](https://adactio.com/journal/17658).

When I was at Condé Nast the company was in the midst of moving all the various international magazine sites for things like GQ and Vogue and so on to a common technology stack using a uniform design language. Their top tier print magazines were still making money off lush contextual adverts. Flicking through an issue of Vogue I’m always struck by how many adverts there are and how their lavish production values make them essentially indistinguishable from much of the content — Vogue fans confirm that the ads are indeed part of the magazines attraction.

Conde Nast, whilst talking a big game about innovating and building on the "unique strengths of their brands" etc. went down the well trodden path of behavioural advertising, a race to the bottom. Anyway, that was only a small part of why I left but the disconect between the stated goals and the reality of the work they were doing was symptomatic of broader organisational issues.

I very much enjoyed both these polyhedra sites

* [http://dmccooey.com/polyhedra/](http://dmccooey.com/polyhedra/ "A")
* [https://polyhedra.tessera.li/](https://polyhedra.tessera.li/#octahedron "https://polyhedra.tessera.li/#octahedron")

I've toyed with the idea of a website called the Campaign For Real Websites (Camrw as in [Camra]()). It would be a directory of sites like this. Sites that have exhaustive personally compiled information on a topic and don't require any kind of cookie dialogue box because they're not tracking you. The sites may have advertising I guess but it would be the contextual kind.

Another site on the the Camrw website (Camrw looks a bit welsh doens't it?) would be [https://sheldonbrown.com/](https://sheldonbrown.com/ "https://sheldonbrown.com/") which is a great resource for bike  stuff (though the advice about lubes doesn't tally with my experience which is WD40 is absolutely fine and keeping your chain clean is really the key to preventing wear -- though I have to admit this is partly just becasue I really hate the pictures of dying fish you gt on the chain lube bottles and would just prefer to replace my chain a little more often than relese that shit into the environment if I can avoid it)

Finally: having quit twitter I am kind of missing the act of typing minor complaints into a text field and then deleting them, also it really highlights how these days if you don't have twitter or face book its very hard to get in touch with a whole swathe of people on the internet. Remeber when we just emailed each other? people had email addresses on their sitre and would actively solicit correspondence/

Liking my new CMS. Clearly it's encouraged me to write more, though I think I'll need to get some kind of spell-checker for Firefox.
