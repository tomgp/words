Raft (1991) -stephen baxter

Finished this a couple of nights ago. 

Amazing how many of Baxter's preoccupations (for better and worse) are present here in his slim first novel: Diamond hard sci-fi, humans surviving in apparently impossible situations (a universe where gravity is 1billion times stronger), nature red in tooth and claw (canibalism though thankfully none of the rapey stuff that mars a fair chunk of his oeuvre), improbable life forms everywhere (most dramatically here in the super dense neutron star material at the hear of a nebula). Anyway, it's fine. But if you're looking to read some Stephen Baxter I'd go with the Vaccuum Diagrams short story collection of the the Manifold trilogy. Or the Long Earth books he wrote with Terry Pratchett which ameliorate a lot worst excesses and are just generally lighter hearted.
