title: The Daylight Gate & The Black Prince
---
I've just finished a double helping of bloody historical fiction:

Jeanette Winterson's _Daylight Gate_ revolving around the [Pendle witch trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendle_witches) is a short sharp novel which lives up to the promise of the publisher and erstwhile film studio _Hammer_. Un-showy kitchen sink realism garnished with bloody torture and a sprinkle of the supernatural to good if limited effect. The books real strength is in its portrayal of its characters relationships.

Adam Robert's _The Black Prince_ is a more ambitious affair, it mixes accepted historical facts with apocrypha and anachronistic media reports in the style of Dos Pasos's USA Trilogy. I really enjoyed this,it is kind of uneven Roberts holds it all together with aplomb. The battle scenes in particular manage a fine balance between excitement in revulsion only fully tipping over into the latter for the books bloody climax; the aftermath of the [siege of Limoges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Limoges).

Apart from anything else it was good to read a couple of books about truly horrific historical periods: Oh my god, the black death! religious persecution during the reign James I! Made me feel a little less bleak about our own historical moment.
