title: Mixed feelings about playing Dungeons and Dragons
---

We visited Glastonbury to get out of London for a couple of days. That bit of the west country is definitely the part of England most likely to be [the shire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_(Middle-earth)) and really is in my view the apotheosis the English managed countryside -- the kind of countryside that results from thousands of years of human stewardship, essentially a massive garden. Next door to our cottage a Japanese family on holiday were in a state of perpetual delight, the countryside really put on a show for them, high contrast rain & sun -- a rainbow, glowing sandstone against a dark sky, perfect green grass with a light frost, a 2000 year old oak tree. I love seeing people experience things that I've become inured to, I feel like it lets me experience them afresh -- this is for me one of the most constant joys of having children.

Glastonbury Abbey ruins are well worth a visit. There's [a list of all the abbots going back to AD600ish](https://www.glastonburyabbey.com/abbots.php), really interesting how the names switch in the hundred years after the Norman conquest from _Ealmund_ and _Aegelward_ and so on to modern English names _Henry_, _Robert_ etc.

The appalling hippy aesthetic of Glastonbury high street on the other hand couldn't be further from the brilliant countryside and layered history of the area.

Whilst we were there I DMed a game of Dungeons and Dragons with my kids -- I haven't played D&D since my early twenties when I was kicked out of the Natural History Museum's RPG club for insufficient commitment. K and J had both been asking to play since they got the 3.5 player manual down off the shelf but frankly I was in two minds about the idea so kept putting it off. I was never a massive fan of D&D per-se, in terms of dice rolling tending to prefer either [epic battles in the 41st millenium](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4001/space-marine) or [more indie fare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogs_in_the_Vineyard). And really, do I want to get my kids interested in a hobby which could -- if past experience is anything to go by -- render them socially beyond the pale? Or maybe the world's better for that stuff now. In the wake of _Harry Potter_ & _Game of Thrones_ leveling up people's tolerance for wizardy bullshit and the internet allowing dispersed groups with niche interests to communicate, do people still get their school bags chucked over a hedge into a canal if they happen to contain a copy of [Realm of Chaos: The Lost And The Damned](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/File:Realms_of_Chaos_The_Lost_and_the_Damned_FCover.jpg)? 

Well anyway after some moderate pestering I relented and sketched up a simple adventure: a tavern, a mysterious disappearance, a forrest, a cave, some sleeping orcs, a baby dragon and a last minute escape -- the basics, it lasted about an hour and a half. And you know, they both loved it! And it was the most fun I've had playing, possibly ever? They entered so readily into the storytelling element jumping around the room as they fought off wolves, snuck past slumbering guards and leaped onto run away wagons. So I guess we'll be playing again. (K: "you know, I thought it was going to be more like a board game, but it's just a story telling game". Spot on!)

Educational bonus: we did plenty of basic dice maths (arithmetic and probability), some handwriting (filling in their character sheets) and reading (figuring out what skills and feats they want from the tables in the book).

PS. It's clear that I'm not a week notes kind of person. Some weeks I have nothing to say, some days I have a ton.

(note -- I wrote this a week a go but forgot to push it)
