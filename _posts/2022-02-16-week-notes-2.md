wow I’m really bad at this weeknotes malarky!

here’s last weeks…

It’s Thursday already and I have forgotten that I’m supposed to be doing week notes

On Monday I started doing daily yoga, then I forgot on Tuesday, managed it on Wednesday and am 50/50 about whether I’ll make it today.

Went to a pub for a work leaving do which had a “garden enclosed on 4 sides and with a roof covering like 99% of the space. They were allowing people to smoke here and so I came home and immediately had ton wash all my clothes, face and what little hair I have left, today I have a sore throat. Can’t believe 1. That they get away with this 2. We used to accept smokers making all our clothes stink for the sake of their addiction.

K started playing Super Mario Odessey so I’ve picked it up again. It’s certainly no Super Mario Galaxy 2, (or even 1) more a slightly better Mario Sunshine.
