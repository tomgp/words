Well! It's been a while, mainly because I tend to post whenever I finish reading a book and I've been reading a big ol' fantasy trilogy: The Broken Earth by N.K. Jemisin all 3 volumes of the series won the Hugo over consecutive years and I think deservedly so.

Impressions: The series is pretty uneven -- as trilogies can tend to be, what turns out to be interesting plot wise by book three isn't necessarily what the author thought it might be at the start of book one. I really liked the first two books but felt the third misfired. The world explored in the first two books has interesting things to say about who gets to be an insider and an outsider and how societies react to and prepare for crises. It's tightly imagined and the themes knight well with the plot. The first two books provide a really interesting lens through which to think about and reflect on power, privlege and race. The third books zooms out and explains how the world came to be and embeds the characters struggles within a broader epic millenia long conflict but this never really stuck for me. The themes don't marry so well with the narrative.

SPEAKING OF THOSE THEMES: Some travelers moved in to Priory Park on Monday evening precipitating much wailing and gnashing of teeth on local social media channels and the school What's App groups -- everyone seems to know someone who's heard about someone being abused or some pub being smashed or some garage being broken into. I've not really seen any of this stuff first hand. There's a bit of extra litter (no more than after the local 10k run) and a smashed phone booth (that was already in a pretty f---d up condition) but broadly everything seems OK. There was definately a late-Balardian vibe to the conversation at the school gates though, the thin veneer of North London liberalism scratched. I get it though, it's a direct challenge to our notions of community space to have a bunch of people rock up and take over the local sports facilities. Who gets to co-opt public space and under what conditions is an ongoing negotiation between different interest groups so unilateral action by people from outside a community can be grating.

Oh! Brexit rumbles on. Environmental disruption ramps up. But I promised not to talk about that stuff too much on this site -- it occupies a large chunk of my brain and I don't need to give over any more. 

But the summer holidays were nice though. Canoeing! Mountain biking! Swimming in rivers! I love that stuff and all of it will carry on regardless.
