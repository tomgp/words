I’m getting quite into Warhammer again having given up the hobby around age 14/15 because a) too expensive an b) not “cool”. I have no big interest in playing the game but i’m really enjoying painting some models for a friend (Nighthaunts and Stormcast eternals if you must know) and diving back into the lore of it is interesting and a good deal of fun after 25 years away — I expect i’ll buy some more models to paint once i’ve done this lot unless i can find someone else who wants some painting done.  
  
Further; I was glad to find on a visit to the store on Tottenham ct road that Kieron Gillen has done a [40k](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Warhammer-40-000) comic. Having had mixed responses to some of his other stuff (Loved Darth Vader, hated Three. Journey into Mystery was fine etc. ) i went in with no expectation and was pleasantly surprised. It reminded me a bit of the recent Dredd movie, rather than diving in and taking on one of the big stories (Necropolis, Cursed Earth etc) its a constrained and manageable introduction to the world, a kind of day in the life. The comic is focused around the leader of the Ultramarines (primarch?) the most big standard of all the space marine chapters as he recounts how he became a  
Marine and does a bit of battling on the side. Its good, the strategy works and Gillen has a great handle on the material, not sure if it’ll bring anyone in to the folks who wasn’t already warhammer aware but that’s fine.  
  
Also enjoying Daniel Lavery’s Warhammer fan fiction eg. [Gore Vidal and Orson Welles Play Warhammer](https://www.thechatner.com/p/gore-vidal-and-orson-welles-play)
