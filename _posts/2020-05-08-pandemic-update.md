Unsurprisingly the government of Boris Johnson, comprised as it is of former bankers, journalists, and management consultants, has f*cked up their handling of the pandemic. [M John Harrison captures the political atmosphere well](https://ambientehotel.wordpress.com/2020/04/17/the-new-ppe/)
> I get the feeling of a country desperately trying to wake itself up and failing.

> Certainly they’re corrupt, certainly their ideology is rubbish, certainly their ties to billionaire capital, fascism and the Gibsonian klept are scary: but the main, the intense, quotidian problem with them has always been their privileged impracticality and their dozy lack of engagement; the basically narcissistic assumption that you can always charm other people into achieving your goals for you.

All off this -- _waves hands generally_ -- enabled by Britain's news media; primarily the shitty newspapers, but the BBC bears a big chunk of responsibility for failing to hold successive governments to account and for acting as an amplifier for the papers and for f*cking Question Time.

Sometimes I think the trick with the newspapers might just be to ignore them. Their circulations are pitiful, a handful of people. A policy of just never mentioning Toby Young or Lawrence Fox, pretending the Telegraph and the Mail and the Murdoch press don't exist, maybe we can wish them out of existence. Just don't retweet that zinging response that links to an article by Melanie Philips or Jeremy Clarkeson don't even mention it, don't even subtweet. These people and institution exists because of attention and giving them our attention and directing other peoples attention towards them is the problem (not all of it but a big chunk). As i say though, this is probably just wishful thinking.

Oh well, this has left me feeling angrier than expected. In my more hopeful moments I like to think that the result of all this will be that people decide that paying more tax to adequately fund the NHS and social services is actually a good idea (education too), whilst also realising that air travel, car use and rampant consumption in all its forms can be massively reduced without making everything unbearable -- the things we miss aren't driving, flying or buying but hanging out with friends, sitting idly on benches, lying in the sun, and walking around aimlessly.

Anyway, I'd like to  write more here again. Perhaps having vaguely vented my despair that'll make it easier.

I've been reading mostly plot-driven books which is fine as far as it goes but it has highlighted to me that I'm not really a plot person -- I mean I guess this should have been obvious to me but reading back to back crime/thriller/mysteries has driven home  that I don't really click with this kind of novel. I find myself impatiently to racing through, not enjoying the journey just rushing towards the destination.
