I just watched Sucker Punch on the strength of this essay “It’s intelligent, well-made, and has a clear and savage point to make” – that sounds good right? Boy was I disappointed.

Note: I didn’t read the whole essay before watching the film because spoilers etc. after the first couple of pars I was like: “hey I love it when a film that appears to be dreadful turns out to be good – trashy films that are actually good are probably one of my favourite things” and I immediately downloaded it and then E was out last night and I watched it. Maybe I raised my expectations were a problem, though TBH they were raised only very slightly.

The basic problem is that the film does say everything Sandifer says it does (Though not the well made bit – I mean it’s basically deliberate and essentially competent I guess but in the same way that one of those Michael Bay Transformers movies is i.e. its noisy and monotonously paced, the action scenes are incredibly formulaic (but that’s the point!), the music – polished metally covers of things like White Rabbit and Raw Power – is terrible.) (Or the intelligent bit – the film’s all important ‘message’ is telegraphed to the viewer culminating in a genuinely laughable closing voiceover. The multi layered structure somehow manages to be both super literal minded in terms of symbolism but also makes no ontological sense whatsoever – who’s the bus driver? should I care? No.) … the film does say everything Sandifer says it does (not very well) and absolutely no more, if the film were entertaining this wouldn’t be a problem but it just isn’t, as noted parenthetically above it’s at best workmanlike, there’s nothing to provoke thought, no interesting questions raised (who’s the bus driver is not an interesting question). I guess the linked essay describes well the film I watched but if everything a film is about can be expressed more entertainingly in a bit of prose that takes like 10-15 minutes to read and fully digest then why make the film? It’s like that thing “what’s your book about” “well if could tell you that in a couple of sentences I wouldn’t have had to write the damn thing” (can’t remember who said it, Le Guin? Jack Kerouac?). Zach Snyder shouldn’t have bothered to make the damn thing. $82,000,000 badly spent.
