I don't think there was any way that I wasn't going to like _Picard_, the latest addition to the Star Trek IP. _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ was an important<sub>1</sub> part of my life growing up and I remember it with a fondness which all but blinds me to it's many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyI542boYs0">flaws and absurdities</a>. And I really like Michael Chabon who's in charge of the writing on the new show, even his <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraph_Avenue_(novel)">lamest books</a> are fabulously plotted and solidly entertaining.

So anyway, yeah, the first episode not much happens but as a result we have almost a whole episode of Patrick Stewart playing Jen-Luc Picard and I loved it. I'm a fan and I feel abundantly served.

1. Important? Feels weird to say that but I think it's right. I remember clearly how I would genuinely look forward to Wednesday 6:30 BBC2 when I could sequester myself in the attic with a cup of tea and our second TV and forget school and everything else for 45 mins. When I was a teenager -- like a lot of people -- I felt a lot of pressure to be cool and cynical and grown up (and I thought those were all the same thing maybe). _Star Trek: TNG_ was resolutely none of those things and as such a great release from pretence. Kind of escapism, but also the opposite, a chance to inhabit myself.
