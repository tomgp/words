I did write a bunch here about the death of Flash but I think that's a story for another day. 2010 was the last time I used Flash for anything of any import.

My colleague Martyn and I developed a set of libraries for Flash that allowed us to knock out thematic maps very easily at this point election results maps were properly comodified eg. here's a map coloured by the the shade of the leaders ties...

As such we could very easily pop them into an HTML page the ease with which we were able to do this served to highlight how the technology was never the determining factor in the quality of the output, the work still needed to be done to contextualise and explain.

So for the 2010 UK General Election much of the development effort in terms of new stuff was spent integrating video into the site in novel ways `picard-face-palm.gif`.
