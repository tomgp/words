What a fantastic opening spread!

I love the way the different elements overlap, Gibson provides very few scale cues and the way the bits interact in the pages’ notional z-axis makes only a sort of sense, can be resolved only in local patches, requires you to be constantly reassesing the size of things and their realtionship to one another, Escher like (but without the irritating tricksyness for its own sake). The borderline-giberish radio chatter only heightens the confusion and then you end up focused on Halo Jones’ face, staring into space, bored in the midst of this amazing confusion.
