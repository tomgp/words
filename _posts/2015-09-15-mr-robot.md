Pretty cool title card.

Enjoying this show on the strength of the first 2 episodes: Repurposing/ updating of cyber-punk tropes last seen in 1995 is not on the face of it a promising idea, but it works I think because clearing away a lot of the futuristic stuff and the orientalism of that sub-genre exposes its nice and noir-ish heart.

Also, the episode names.
