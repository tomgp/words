I’m enjoying being able to see people more often but i’m not looking forward to working in an office again. The roads are full of traffic again and drivers seem to have forgotten what a miserable experience driving in London is and are taking out their frustration on all and sundry.  
  
Combining those two themes: I was cycling to meet some work colleagues at the pub the other day and turning into a T junction was confronted by a Volvo SUV coming up the middle of the road with no apparent intention of getting in his (i assume, safe assumption though i think) own lane so i tightened my turn and my pedal hit the ground stopping the bike dead and skidding me across the tarmac ending with my head a couple of feet from the Volvo’s back wheels, the driver calmly pausing at the junction and ignoring me before continuing on their way. Anyway, further evidence that “cars are for c&nts” as was a catch-phrase on an internet forum i used to hang out on when such things existed back in the 00s.  
  
I’m fine though, my favourite SunnO))) T shirt has a big hole in the back and both my wrists are sprained and bruised making just about everything a bit awkward but it could have been worse.  
  
Opinion: In all the debate around the safety (or otherwise) of e-scooters no one ever seems to address the elephant in the room which is that they (and every other form of transport) would be a lot safer if there weren’t a bunch of distracted people barging around encased in thousands of kilograms of metal (cars etc.)  
  
Also: the wrist thing has kind of put the kibosh temporarily on my re-nascent hobby of painting plastic toys, more information about which can be found on [my specialist instagram account](https://instagram.com/middleage_of_sigmar) .
