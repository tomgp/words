Read a couple of first novels -- or rather, as shall be revealed, read one started one -- Elizabeth Gaskell's _Mary Barton_ and Patrick Hamilton's recently back in print _Twopence Coloured_. Which did I finish? Well in the spirit of Gaskell's spoilerific chapter titles * it was _Mary Barton_.

I often find there's a lot to like in the less polished early work of writers, they're not as in control so things might turn out more unpredictably, they haven't yet learned the rules and there's an unevenness -- Emily BrontÃ«'s Wuthering Heights is a kind of shining example of this kind of thing. I'm not a huge fan but there really is nothing like it. Some writers are able to capture that spark and carry it through their careers. 

Anyway, Mary barton has a bit of that unevenness. Gaskell isn't really able to reconcile her beliefs about how thw world works with the story she sets out to tell -- I think she does a better job in North and South and in someways Cranford is the best expression of her world view though it lacks the urban setting that makes the former novels so compelling as historical documents. The first half of _&hellip;Barton_ has some pretty brutal depictions of poverty in industrial revolution Manchester (the notes of the penguin edition note that she was probably sugar coating stuff. Yikes! cf <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2153/2153-h/2153-h.htm#c6">Chapter VI. Poverty and death</a>) before changing gear for the second half into a story about individual redemption and the importance of understanding between the classes. Anyway.

I didn't get far with the Patrick Hamilton book, though it might just have been that my mood on the train back from seeing Mac DeMarco in Margate wasn't tuned correctly. I'm a huge fan of _Hangover Square_ and esp. _Slaves to Solitude_ but earlier in his career he didn't have his tendency towards florid descriptive passages under control, there's a bit of this in _20,000 Streets under the Sky_, Emma bounced off that one. Anyway, I'll probably try again after Summer.
