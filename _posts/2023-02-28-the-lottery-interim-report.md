Reading Shirley Jackson's short story collection _The Lottery: Or the Adventures of James Harris_ and let me tell you, some of these stories are mighty bleak. I'm find myself frequently reminded of Ray Bradbury's shorts from the same era (40's, 50's), but Jackson's a kind of through a glass darkly version of Bradbury, the setups and characters are familiar, the sympathies of the author lie in the same place but where Bradbury will often have a transcendent moment or at least a realisation of harm done (I'm thinking [All Summer In A Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Summer_in_a_Day) in the case of the latter) Jackson just lets her characters stew and will often double down. The last passage of [The Flower Garden](https://ashleyvaught.com/suburban-micro-aggressions-shirley-jacksons-short-story-flower-garden/) where the protagonist turns away from her erstwhile friend and walks away "with great dignity", embracing her class position in the racist society, is a particularly effective gut punch.
