title: Procrastination & Home Counties

Finished Jarret Kobek's _["HOE #999"](https://bookworks.org.uk/node/154)_ book. More enjoyable than I expected it would be going in but certainly not something I'll be buying multiples of as xmas presents. Earlier this year I noticed Kobek didn't have a wikipedia page so I made a stub and decided to write one but then I gave up and I ordered all his books from a variety of small presses and Waterstones (because the writers of wikipedia pages for authors have presumably all read the complete works of their subject right?) and so the actual writing of the page will have to wait till next year probably -- A+ procrastination.

We went to Kent for the weekend to visit friends who moved to Tunbridge Wells. I don't get Kent -- a bland (late) Ballardian landscape of dual carriage ways and golf courses. When I think of British dystopias I don't think it's a coincidence that for me those which resonate most strongly (_Children Of Men_, _Ridley Walker_, _Kingdom Come_ (is Kingdom Come even dystopia anymore? It feels like the slimmest possible margin exists between our world and the reality of the novel)), are those set predominantly in the home counties -- a cultural blast zone around London.

Started reading _The Spire_ by William Golding, generally speaking I always seem to enjoy books about monks (_Narcissus and Goldmund_ is an all time fave). Took me a couple of tries to get going but it's very much my kind of novel; simple words put carefully together, much is unsaid, the novel suggests a vast world from a very narrow point of view.

Oh and I'm back on Hearthstone. Still largely playing tempo-mage or odd-paladin for ranked play, occasionally odd-control-priest and on the side trying to construct an interesting and competitive shaman deck (seems the choice with shaman at the moment is one or the other). Messing around with rogue and warlock in casual mode.  blah blah blah.
