title: A disappointment
---
When there's a list of books that you simply _must_ read and it's all non-fiction. The list includes _Sapiens_ by Yuval Noah Harari (or maybe one of his other books), a few years back it would have included _Freakonomics_. There's definitely space for a "business" book or two on the list. There's an air of reading as eating your broccoli, though the books listed must be easily digestible, nothing that takes chewing or might be an acquired taste. Some of the books will be good books but they will be preferred for their actionable business insights rather than any ability to provoke thought or wonder or questions.

A minor but frequent disappointment.
