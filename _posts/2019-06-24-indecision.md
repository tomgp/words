I'm indecisive. My friend <a href="http://www.cutlasses.co.uk/">Scott</a> was the first to bring this character trait to my notice when I was about 19 or so as I dragged him up and down Park Street in Bristol looking for something to eat or trying to decide what records I should buy with my student loan. The subsequent 20-ish years have only confirmed his diagnosis, I have trouble making my mind up.

This is especially true of large purchases. So when I decided to plonk down a significant amount on a new bike it wasn't a decision that happened quickly, 6 to 8 months i've been pondering this, wasting a couple of hours every so often clicking around reviews and bike shop websites, going round in circles. Anyway I finally decided and submitted my credit card details to the relevant website only to get a mail back 5 days later telling me the bike was no longer available... anywhere. 

Arg.

Another manifestation of this indecisiveness is an inability to hold an opinion with any degree of consistency, and regular feelings of terrible shame when someone reminds me of opinion which I almost certainly held and expressed with great conviction (probably a few pints in at the pub) a month or two back but which now makes my skin crawl with it's naive idiocy.

A result of this is that for the last 5 to 10 years or so I've tried to resist the urge to have opinions if I can, at least strongly held ones or publicly expressed one. [Strong opinions weakly held](https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/07/strong_opinions.html) and all that. Having a blog is a great venue for airing poorly thought out opinions. Bob Mortimer on the Adam Buxton podcast said he didn't really value the currency of opinions, preferring the currency of humour. This all raises questions too about what constitutes an opinion, a political position, a taste or a preference some of which seem unavoidable and some of which are uncontroversial in most cases e.g. most tastes are relatively benign most political positions can be divisive. Anyway.

With that said there are a few positions I've managed to stick to since my teenage years. These are they (plus sources)...

 * Cars are bad, the social and environmental costs outweigh the benefits (Julian Cope's Autogeddon record and my subsequent seeking out of it's namesake, the <a href="http://cfu.freehostia.com/Members/colin/autogeddon/">epic poem by Heathcote Williams</a>)
 * Novels are the best kind of book (Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse 5)
 * The world is complicated but you can't give up trying to understand it even if you know you never will (The novels and short stories of Philip K Dick)
 
It is worth noting that all the cultural artefacts parenthesised above were sourced from Wilmslow Public Library so to the list I add.
 
 * Public libraries are great
