I've (technically we, but E was away last Friday) started hosting a table top gaming evening.
Last Friday of each month. We played _escape from the aliens in outer space_ a tense game of bluffing and deduction, 
thematically it's The Thing x Alien. Anyway, as I approach 42 I've decided to lean-in to this kind of thing.

On the subject: Took the kids to a tabletop game show up the hill in Alexandra Palace. [Good grief writing on an ipad is terrible, 
cant wait to have that new mini keyboard thing in ipadOS.]

I've been making slow progress through a bunch of short story collections and an impenetrable non-fiction slab _The Stack_. The only book I finished last month was Posy Simmonds's _Cassandra Darke_ which i think might be my favourite of her long form stuff.

Writing on an ipad keyboard in github's file editor is a terrible experience.
