2008 was the first presidential election I worked on. The US electoral system is much more mapable than the UK, a reasonable number of roughly similar sized chunks, many of which have nice straight edges and to top it off there are only two colours. There are awkward bits of course, Maine and it's split electoral college vote, all those small states top right, Hawaii and Alaska. But there are well worn conventions for dealing with those. 

With this election we agreed on a couple of goals 1. distribute the dynamically updating content around the site rather than putting it in one central place and 2. integrate Flash and HTML content so we could use Flash for graphical elemnts and HTML/ CSS for basic lists and tables UI and have the two update and interact with one another.

(Those result bars top right animated between several different states hence Flash.)

A real boon to this project: at the time Scott Byrne-Fraser was leading the design team I was working with. Scott has a very pragmatic and un-precious approach to working which allowed us devs input to the design work on the strength of what we learned by building. The result was that we were able to add many little features and interactions that may not have been anticipated in a more traditional workflow (eg. the little pie chart tooltips came out of wanting to check values on the map corresponded with those on the rest of the page during developemnt) it felt very much like we were working with the grain of our material. 

Here's the electoral college cartogram view...

I was never really happy with this layout at the time, but looking bad it's not so bad.

We also produced some little departure board widgets for putting on the home page and in side bars which would animate and alert readers to recent data updates and upcoming results.

Similarly, during the campaign we produced some dynamicaly updating, moderately interactive promotional graphics to go within stories.

It's an interesting question as to whether a news story should show the latest polling data or the polling data at the time the story was published in this kind of graphic. As with many things the answer is probably "it depends".

The map above was used during the campaign and is more closely related to the local election maps where all the data and UI elements are conatinaed within a single blob of Flash. Look at those horrible Flex scroll-bars I have no idea why we couldn't prevent the horizontal one from being draw but apparently we couldn't.

Random recollections: 

This was the first election on which I was tech lead for the client-side. I found it incredibly stressful. Also, we had our first child on the way. As a result I'd consistently wake at 3 in the morning and rehearse everything that could possibly go wrong with both situations eventually falling back to sleep at about 6:30. 

I have a feeling that this was the last election where I stayed up all night too -- they all blur into one after a bit. Obama's victory felt like an important moment and everything had run smoothly overnight so I walked home feeling bouyed up, slept till about 10:30 and then -- as was my tradition after election all nighters -- ate a massive fry up at [Jacks in Queens Park](http://georgedee.com/jacksqueenspark/) (The _Double_ rather than the _Triple_, even so I didn't need to eat the rest of the day)
