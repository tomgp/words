So the median UK income ([according to wikipedia](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FIncome_in_the_United_Kingdom&t=Mzg3OTkwYjE3MDBhNmUwZmU2M2E2NzQ5Nzc2MjY3YWYzYzQ2Mjk5NSw5c3VQRzRtTQ%3D%3D)) is about £21,000. That is, half of all people in the UK earn more than that. On that you’d pay £2,080 income tax and £1,553 in National Insurance – £3,633.

[Facebook paid £4,372 last year](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmusic%2F2015%2Fnov%2F12%2Fone-direction-rack-up-454m-profit-pay-more-tax-facebook&t=NzZhNGZlYzQ5ZWJkY2I0N2NkYTQ0NGJmY2I2M2JlY2Q0ZjVhM2QyYyw5c3VQRzRtTQ%3D%3D) – if the company was an individual they would have paid that much on earnings £23,500 in the UK last year – just a fraction above what most people can expect to earn and contribute.
