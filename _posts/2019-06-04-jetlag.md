Just got back from New York. Jetlagged. Seeing jetlagged children made me understand why as a ten or eleven year old I was in a hotel in LA watching American werewolf in London, a film clearly unsuitable for someone of that age. Of course I was awake because I had jetlag. 

Having said that, in New York they were showing Die Hard 2 one day whilst we were eating breakfast and one time I read someone earnestly explaining on the internet how Fury Road was a great film for a 7 year old because -strong female role model- so I guess USAsians have different standards than Europeans re exposing children to screen violence.
