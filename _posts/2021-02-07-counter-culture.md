title: Counter culture

What is counter culture when all culture is published in the same streams? How can anything on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram be considered countercultural "a culture whose values and norms of behavior differ substantially from those of mainstream society"? Social media seems to represent the final state (hopefuly!) of 20th century culture industries' ability to commodify dissent...

Any counterculture that exists is by necessity invisible to the social media feeds, it has to be in order to resist being used to make money for Zuck and co. The classic 80s/90s strategy of transgression just doesn't work any more GG Alin x the Internet is not far from Donald Trump or any number of lesser alt-right trolls.

That said, I think I'm a bit more hopeful about the possibility space here than I was a year ago. Beaker browesr in particular seems like a really well thought out and ergonomic place for experimentation around alternative networked public spaces -- it asks for a level of technical expertise similar to that required for editing a MySpace page back in the day and discoverability is terrible but I think we just have to accept that as the price to pay to avoid the killing gaze of social media once Google turns it's eye of Sauron to p2p sites indexing and caching things like Beaker's Hyperdrives and IPFS the endeavour is in trouble, that space will be subsumed int he web. Can these technologies recreate the semi-piblic spaces of dingy basement clubs and tiny zine fairs? I hope they can, becoming places wehre ideas can grow for a bit outside the burning daylight of social media.

EDIT about 15 mins after I clicked publish:

I found [this article which articulates some to the stuff I was trying to get at above](https://www.documentjournal.com/2021/01/the-internet-didnt-kill-counterculture-you-just-wont-find-it-on-instagram/). It even mentions GG Allin, it must be something in the water.

>What logic could possibly be upended by punks, goths, gabbers, or neo-pagans when the internet, a massively lucrative space of capitalization, profits off the personal expression and political conflict of its users?

Absolutely! At this point staying at home and painting model spaceships (and not photographing them!) feels weirdly rebelious.

>Despite being informed by billions, this new technological hegemony isn’t democratic; it’s a swarm-led form of para-governance programmed to maximize engagement while obfuscating responsibility for the social and environmental damage it wreaks

Love the phrase "swarm-led form of para-governance"
