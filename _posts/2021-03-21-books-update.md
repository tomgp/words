The _Slaughterhouse 5_ comic was good, faithful with occasional sparks of originality. Ryan North is a great comics writer, reading _Adventure Time_ with J\_ is always a joy but here it feels like he's perhaps too reverent? I don't know, it probably takes about the same amount of time to read the novel as it does the adaptation and the original is much deeper and richer and stranger.  
  
_Economic Science Fictions_ had some decent pieces but it mostly didn't click for me. A lot of it had that academic writing thing where I get to the end of an essay and it feels both like i've been reading it for years and like I've just read the introduction and haven't got much out of it. I think this is likely as much a fsailing on my part as on any of the academics.  
  
_The Long Earth_ was exactly what I expected. Inventive world building but not world changing. I expect I'll read the rest of the series in time but I'm not in a rush.  
  
_The Owl Service_ I read to K\_. It is a wierd childrens book, all atmosphere and allusion and it expects quite a lot of a young reader in terms of an understanding of class and cross cultural dynamics (esp. a reader separated from the action by 50 odd years). Not sure I'd recomend it but it leaves an impression.  
  
_Girl Woman Other_. It's a shame this had to share the Booker with Margret Atwood (I've not read _The Testaments_ but I've always been ambivalent towards her stuff and a sequel to _The Handmaids Tale_ coinciding with a  popular HBO adaptaion of same doesn't fill me with excitement) though I didn't pay much attention at the time I'm sure there are some 'takes' on the internet which i might look up. Also, look, did you see what just happened? I'm all of a sudden not talking about the book. The book is as you'd probably expect from the surrounding chatter very good, Evaristo has a great command of character and achieves an awful lot with not much, so many characters all alive in a brief novel.
