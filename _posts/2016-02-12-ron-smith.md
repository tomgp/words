I never liked Ron Smith when I was reading 2000AD regularly as a child but I think he might be my favourite Dredd artist these days (though can’t say I have much exposure to Dredd post prog 900 or so). Not for the way he draws the main character which I still don’t really like that much, but for the way he draws the city and the citzens. With regard to the former; he manages to cram a huge amount of detail in without the layouts getting crowded, often jamming different perspectives hard up against each other in a way that makes the whole thing look perfectly natural and yet slightly headache inducing. He pulls a similar trick with his Mega Citizens; they often have a slightly retro 60s/70s look about them (one of the things I used to dislike), a kind of agressive normality, but then Smith freezes them in unflatering positions, their faces grotesque (the lady on the right of that cover is a good example). The closest comparison I can think of is Dan Clowes, though I get the feeling Clowes has more sympathy for his creations. The collection of Dredd Daily Star strips he produced is certainly one of my most heavily thumbed collections.
