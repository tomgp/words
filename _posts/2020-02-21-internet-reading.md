Some things I've read on the internet this week that might be worth your time.

__[On Design Thinking](https://nplusonemag.com/issue-35/reviews/on-design-thinking/)__ by Maggie Gram is a good overview of the history of that idea, and more broadly the discipline (or lack therof) of design. Focusing on the tension between the systematisation of the design process and Horst Rittel's contention that such processes are doomed only to be able to deal with superficial problems...
> For Rittel, design problems’ wickedness meant that they could never be subject to a single process of resolution. There could be no one “method.” Textbooks tended to break down, say, engineering work into “phases”: “gather information,” “synthesize information and wait for the creative leap,” et cetera. But for wicked problems, Rittel wrote, “this type of scheme does not work.” Understanding the problem required understanding its context.

__[Reading Colonialism in "Parasite"](https://tropicsofmeta.com/2020/02/17/reading-colonialism-in-parasite/)__. 
If you've seen the fim you want to read this.

A close reading of the Oscar winning film in which Ju-Hyun Park digs into the language of Parasite (visual and, like, actual language) and shows how it weaves a critque of colonialsm/ cultural imperialism into the fabric of its film making. I have to admit to not being so taken with this film as most other people seem to be, I thought it was really good and fantatically put together (the bit during the flood as the family descends from the house its particularly striking) but it didn't really spark to life for me in the way that Bong Joon-ho’s other films have. Still, will definately see it again and feel lie this piece will give me a better appreciation of it.

__[The Fix-up](http://amechanicalart.blogspot.com/2019/11/the-fix-up.html)__ by Adam Roberts. Morphosis is one of the blogs I've been really enjoying since getting back in to reading (and writing) them over the last year. Robert's posts really highlight what I love about the form, half baked ideas given more space than they'd ever get on a commercial website, let alone an actual printed thing. Niches expanded to whole rooms of playful thought. In this post he argues that the SF fix-up novel (where an author takes a bunch of short stories and writes some extra glue in the form of timelines and bridging chapters and other generic connective tissue an makes a novel [c.f.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fix-up)) far from being just a commercially driven oddity is a kind of apotheosis of the genre and more culturally influenctial than we give it credit for.

>the ‘fix-up’ has had a much larger, perhaps even a shaping, effect on the entire later development of SF than is realised. I don't just mean those occasional SF novels today that are made up of discrete elements tessellated: Simmons’s Hyperion say, or Jennifer Egan’s Visit From the Goon Squad—it's also in the way TV shows like Doctor Who or Star Trek assemble mega-texts out of lots of short-story-ish discrete elements, something (as per the MCU) increasingly mimicked by cinema. Only die-hard fans read new SF short stories today, but the form of the short story feeds directly into contemporary SF in several key ways. Speaking for myself, I find these formal possibilities really interesting: the jolting dislocation of it, the quasi-modernist experimentation; textual tessellation but in a pulp, populist idiom. 

Plus the comments beneath the post are good. Not often you get to say that these days.
