**Monstrous Affections – An Anthology of Beastly Tales**

A collection of YA fantasy stories involving a) monsters (ghosts, demons, vampires, ancient gods inclusive) b) affection (boyfriends, girlfriends, parents, children, brothers, sisters etc.)

I loved this but: [You know when you eat a whole 8-pack of tunnock’s caramels](http://blog.toffeemilkshake.co.uk/post/113243963302/working-from-home-in-real-danger-of-eating-a) and feel sick for the whole rest of the day and until about lunchtime the next? It’s 400 odd pages long and with a couple of exceptions this is just a sweetshop of a book, after munching through in under a week I really felt I needed some literary vegetables, metaphorically speaking.
