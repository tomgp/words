title: Flattening of identities
---
One of the promises of the internet in the 90s was that you could be anonymous, you could re-invent yourself and you could play with identity or identities. No one in "real" pre-internet-life has one simple identity. We* behave differently with work colleagues, with friends, with family, with shop staff, with strangers in clubs. The internet seemed to me to promise a greater breadth of possibilities in terms of how I could express myself, different identities in different contexts. This did not come to pass.

Jarret Kobeks extended essay about recently shot rapper XXXTentacion examines via the medium of his twitter history the mechanisms by which  social media flattens people down to a single expression, restricts their possible behaviours and ultimately circumscribes peoples life chances.

\* look I hate this "we" that gets used in internet think pieces and blog posts I really hate the way it co-opts the reader to a point of view or a generalisation and if I was being less lazy I would excise it from any thing I write BUT time etc. 

Specifically, in the case above I know people who seem to have no problem with ignoring these boundaries but I think the thing I'm talking about is generally true, your mileage may vary.
