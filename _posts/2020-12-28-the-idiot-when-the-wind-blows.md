Well. Christmas happened. A brexit deal happened.

I finished Elif Batuman’s debut novel. It was genuinely funny, though occasionally difficult to read (in a wincing in sympathetic recognition kind of way). I feel like I was definitely an idiot during my late teens early twenties and the fact that my university experience happened at the same time as the novel gives the whole thing an extra layer. The feeling of email on a UNIX terminal is brilliantly evoked. The situations where you’re waiting for someone and you don’t have a mobile phone too... a kind of mild anxiety but also, from today’s vantage point a great sense of freedom. 

i think my plan next year is that the period between Xmas and new year I’m going to turn off phone, computer etc. Like an annual sabbath.

I also read When the Wind Blows. I’d seen the cartoon in the 90s but has only  poor recollection of it. The comic is tragic but what struck me most is way Briggs nails the the dialogue so completely. There’s lot of resonance for any one who’s spent the year listening to jingoistic politicians trying to sound authoritative whilst they mangle the communication of half understood scientific advice.

i got some model paints for Xmas so have undertaken to paint a bunch of space ship miniatures from the board game Red Alert which I picked up on sale a couple of months back. Painting/ drawing is totally possible whilst listening to music/podcasts in a way that multi tasking rarely is for me. They must use completely separate parts of my brain.
