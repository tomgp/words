Katie has been listening to Capital radio during breakfast (inspired by the fact that one of the presenters took part in _Strictly Come Dancing_) so for the first time in ~ 20 years I am totally familiar with the UKs most popular 10-20 songs for any given week. My feelings range from, "yeah, that's pretty nice" to "I just don't get this, I feel old" but mainly just revolve around how commercial radio is terrible -- a tiny ever-repeating playlist, constant adverts for fast food and celebrity gossip.

I've been playing _Into the Breach_; it's right up my street obviously, though it does feel like a gateway drug to me buying _Disgea_ for the Switch which... do I really need to sink more hours into that game? (I do, but understand that it will stop me from doing anything else for at least 6 months, probably a year -- I've been wondering if the ideal situation might be for me to start working in my spare time on a turn based strategy game, I feel like spending hours 'playtesting' such a thing might feel less like throwing time into the void whilst still scratching the itch to position and move little things around a grid)
