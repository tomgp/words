Writing this in the github  file editor. expect typos ( or the swipe typing + autocorrect equivalent, the wrong word spelled  correctly , swipeos).

anyway. i really enjoyed Patricia Lockwood's  Priestdaddy.  starts off a breezy comic memoir but more frequently as the book goes on it enters both darker and more luminous territory. i  laughed, i  cried!

After that i  finally got round to reading a second Sarah Moss book. I really enjoyed  her first, Cold Earth, nearly 10  years back. In  Ghost wall she's  recognisably  the same writer but it's a more confident more dense book in spite of its tiny page count something that opens up in your brain in the days after you finish it.
