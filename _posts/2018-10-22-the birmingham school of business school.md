I enjoyed this longish Tim Harford piece when it was published a while back in the FT and it's stuck with me since then. Now it's on his website it's available for free. I find origanisational structures pretty fascinating, the effects they have on individuals and what they can and can't do in society. I put this down to an extended tenure at the BBC (on and off from 2001 - 2010)followed/ interspersed by shorter stints within other ostensibly comparable orgs doing similar things. It's interesting to compare and contrast but really that's a subject more suited to the pub I think.

## D&D

I got out a D&D players handbook (3.5 ed) and got my kids to make up characters -- basically as a strategy to keep them occupied in a vaguely educational fashion, a bit of maths, some reading and writing -- whilst I read my book on Sunday. Now it looks like we might actually have to play the damn game _picard-face-palm.gif_. Personally I was always more into the world building and character creation than the actual adventuring, I spent many orders more time drawing maps of dungeons and adventurers with cool armour and weapons than actually rolling dice to check for traps etc. The fussiness of the D&D rules seems particularly absurd to me in the wake of having played recent indie RPGs which do a much better job of generating dramatic stories with a much lighter rule-set (e.g. Vincent Baker's Dogs in the Vinyard which has a particularly elegant combat system based on escalating commitment and consequences)

## Further Wizardy Bullshit

Watched the _Warcraft_ movie. Some observations 
 1. Has any director had a more consistent downward trajectory than Duncan Jones? I haven't seen his most recent offering -- some cyberpunk thing with Eric from _True Blood_ in it but it sounds like it might be worse than _Warcraft_. Whereas Jake Gyllenhall on a train; pretty good, and Moon; good verging on really good. 
 2. _Warcraft_ itself was pretty awful. Masses of exposition and backstory and characters you don't care about and it already felt about 3 hours too long by the time the opening credits rolled. BUT there was something kind of fascinating in the fact that it was a big budget action film that felt incompetent in so many ways -- like interestingly inept? In an era of endless competent and satisfactory Disney/Marvel/Starwars movies something odd that doesn't really work in an interesting way is kind of welcome. 

With those Marvel movies especially I always imagine the commissioning process is something along the lines of a deli counter where Disney execs come along and are like "Two and a half hours of Iron Man please" and the production team crank the handle and voila, two and a half hours of Iron Man product is extruded from the machine.
