Gene Wolfe! Anything I say about Gene Wolfe who died yesterday will seem trite or hyperbolic or both but it's all true. He was a one off. Reading Gene Wolfe is never passive, he asks you to do some work and that work is rewarded by stories that live with you and change the way you read *.

<blockquote>Lastly, let me urge you to treat this and all books with respect. We will all benefit if you do. You cannot judge this book now. You will not even be able to judge it rightly when you have read its last story. Ten (or twenty) years from now you will know it was a good book if you remember any of the tales you are about to read.

Meanwhile, its author begs you to preserve it as a physical object, so that at an appropriate time it can be shared by others. If you have bought it, those others may be friends you have not met or children you have thus far only dreamed of. If you have borrowed it from a library, they are your peers in the community, having the same rights in it as yourself. Let me tell you a story.</blockquote>
