I watched Toy Story 4 with the kids on the weekend. Solid 2nd tier Pixar fare. Tears were shed. The difference in rendering quality between the first film and this one is incredible, particularly noticeable because Bo Peep is back and her glazed porcelain material is flawless. 

There's an enjoyable thread in the film  where it gestures towards the joys of a more radical counter cultural lifestyle; the GI Joe stand-ins who are are going to a party to "get played with", the night club with the stoned & disemboweled zebra character. Ultimately the story settles predictably on a more conservative message than the wholesale rejection of (toy)societal norms -- something about moving on and letting your kids go and whatever.

Anyway. This all seemed germane to the discussions around corporate co-opting of Pride events, capitalism is so damn effective at blunting the radical potential of movements ...

... because there's not many of us who totally resist the allure of 501s (or equiv).

I also saw Hereditary. Meh.
