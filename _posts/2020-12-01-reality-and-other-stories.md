I'm trying out forestry.io so I can update this site more easily. It seems OK? It was easy to set up at least.

A month in work's going OK I think, I mean it's work but still. Aside from that though it feels like a bunch of other stuff is hanging in the balance. Now E and I both have full time jobs there's no redundancy in the system (no pun intended). K is home every other day because of staff shortages due to isolation requirements. J's school has several classes isolating. It's like that bit in a video game where you stagger, depleated, to the end of the level (the level in this case being 2020). 

Speaking of video games I've been playing _Left 4 Dead_ with friends most Saturdays after family Strictly viewing. Why aren't there more co-op shooters like that? Maybe there are. Good times!

Anyway, as you may have guessed by the title of the post I finished reading John Lanchester's recent short story collection (Reality and Other Stories). They're ghost stories with technology/  social media/ modern angsts as their fulcrum. There's a decent MR James pastiche and a couple of interesting ideas but there's just nothing that scary in there. Broadly, it feels to me that people like Kelly Link and to a lesser extent China Mi√©ville are doing a much better job of highlighting the unheimlich in the contemporary world.

During Saturday's zombie shooting I discussed it with renowned horror lit fan/ practitioner Dan and he felt the same; Lanchester just wasn't familiar enough with the genre to know that the moves he was making were the most basic.
