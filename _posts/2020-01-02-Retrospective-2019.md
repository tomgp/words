I've read other review of the year type things and they've noted how the year seemed to go on and on forever. For me it was the opposite. 2019 seems barely to have happened. Perhaps it was just relatively peaceful on a personal level compared to 2017 & 18 which involved changing jobs and all sorts of other stress. Or maybe it was that everything seemed to be holding its breath waiting for Brexit to happen or not (spoiler it's happening).

## Anyway, what did happen?

<a href="https://www.toffeemilkshake.co.uk/books/">I read 34 books</a>.

I joined the London Cycling Campaign and went on a couple of protest rides which I greatly enjoyed. I hadn't been to any protests since the Iraq war ones in the early 2000s and cycling around the center of London with a bunch of other people who think cars should just flat out be banned from the center of cites did my psyche a world of good.

I started organising a board game evening. Still early days but it's going well. My initial aim was to get some people to play _Brass: Birmingham_ with but each time we've had too many guests which is actually a fantastic result. As peoples lives have become busier, with kids and so on it's good to have a monthly thing where people can come over if they can make it and not if they can't, it prevents the endless Doodle polls. Also table games are nice way to round out a week, if you don't have the energy to socialise you can enjoy peoples company without the pressure to speak too much.

At the start of the year I resolved to make a game of some sort and I've sort of done that but haven't had much time or inclination to do much out of office coding so it's a bit half-hearted. <a href="https://www.toffeemilkshake.co.uk/puzzle-poker/">Here it is, a puzzle/ card game</a> not properly tested but basically working. I need to work on a proper tutorial I think.

Holiday wise, we've been to Wales (near Dolgellau) and France (near LÃ©zignan). Our only flights have been to New York and back for my mothers birthday but I had hoped to not do any flying -- maybe next year.

Work-wise it's been a bit of an odd one. Lots of small clients but some interesting work. On the down side, the disillusionment I've felt over the past few years with the direction which web development is taking though shows no sign of abating. I'd like to try to articulate this better over the next couple of months, for my own sake as much as anything.

I did a bunch of child raising which I could go on about at great length but I'll spare you (and future them).

## What I'd like to do more of

Drawing. Maybe a life drawing class?

I'd like to do some other on the side web dev project. I have an idea.

Must get back into yoga.

Meeting up with people I haven't seen for too long.

Sleep.

## What I'd like to do less of 

Video games. I fell back into playing them more this year and last having quit them for a number of years in the wake of the _gamergate_ shit storm. I don't feel I'm getting good return on my time from them, I enjoy them but they usually go on too long, particularly I'd like to kick Hearthstone off my ipad. (The games I did like this year? _Wilmot's Warehouse_ and _Dicey Dungeons_. The former in particular seems very respectful of player time and attention and is a lovely thing)

Flying. See above.

Meat. I didn't eat much meat this year but if ever I ate out I still tended to err on the side of non-veg, not liking mushrooms can be a problem. Going to try to fix that. (That said, I do want to go to Black Axe Mangal at some point, maybe a last hurrah)

Twitter. Having been off Facebook for a few years now I think this month is the month I delete Twitter. Ideally I'd like to go further and disentangle myself from Apple and Google too but that's going to take a bit more planning.

Anyway, __Happy New Year!__
