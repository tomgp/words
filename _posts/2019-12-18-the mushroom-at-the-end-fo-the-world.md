Finished _The Mushroom at the End of the World_. OK, I skimmed the last third. It was fine but dissapointing (I'd heard a couple of glowing recomendations). A lot of research spread thinly and plenty of arguing against straw-man versions of biological/ evolutionary sciences. I'm not a biologist but I think I know enough to know that the author mischaracterises a bunch of stuff (e.g. the modern synthesis is totally fine with horizontal geen transfer and biology in general has extensively studied colonial organisms, commensalism etc. to the extent that there are episodes of the kids TV show Octonauts where the ideas are discussed). THere's also the fact that it never really colapses the distinction between humans and nature which it claims to be written in defiance of. John Gray's _Silence of Animals_ is a good survey of literature and nature writing which has effectively collapsed this false separation. For a book that is constantly telling you how wide ranging it is it seemed oddly narrowly.

We went to church on the weekend to sing some carols. We normally do carol singing at the community center but we missed it this year -- I'm an avowed atheist but a big fan of carols with their catchy tunes and weird lyrics 

> Lo he abhors not the virgins womb!

I don't think I'd been in a church during an actual church activity (as opposed to architectural sight-seeing) for maybe 23/24 years? My school used to have church services for xmas and for founders day so I guess that was probably the last time (except weddings which don't count).

As a child I used go to church quite a lot, sang in the choir etc. in our village in Wales is was more a community thing than a religious thing or at least that's how it seemed to me. Anyway, I guess this means I'm culturally Christian, conversant with most of the stuff in the bible, know the words to hymns and so on, even though I have no belief in the magic stuff. Part of me always hopes for a kind of religion that's more about community and practice than the contents of your head, but I think evangelism is too baked in to Christianity to hope that we might ever separate it out.

Still, everyone was friendly and it was a good christmassy way to start the day before picking up a tree. We might well go back again next year.
