title: Milkman

Just finished Anna Burn's book Milkman. Certainly the chewiest book I've read in a while but it does amply reward the effort you put into it. A portrait of a time  (1970s) and place (Belfast) and a young woman in that time and place, the novel looks at how political and personal violence operates and traumatises on both an individual and societal level -- a kind of shutting off of affect and nuance and a rejection of complexity with tragic consequences.

Also, surprisingly funny and the ending is upbeat(ish). 

Recommended.

Other news: I went over to Tom and Matt's place to watch 42nd Street last Friday (Joyous, only occasionally problematic). I've known Tom for nearly 30 years now but we learned something new about one another: He can't understand why anyone would want to paint gaming miniatures to play D&D with whereas I'd happily spend all day painting and never play the game. I suggested a collaboration, I paint the miniatures, he plays the game.

We went to a trampoline park on Sunday. I don't really get why so few parent get on the trampolines and bounce. Why would you not want to bounce on a bunch of trampolines?

Today I am aching from trampolining.
