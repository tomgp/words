> Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass under the trees on a summers day, listening to the murmur of water, or watching the clouds float across the blue sky, is by no means a waste of time.

 -- John Lubbock, The Use of Life (1895)

[From a Psyche article about rest](In his book The Use of Life (1895), the Victorian author John Lubbock wrote:      Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass under the trees on a summers day, listening to the murmur of water, or watching the clouds float across the blue sky, is by no means a waste of time.)
