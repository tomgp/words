I feel like there’s something missing in the commentary and analysis surrounding Labour consistent failure at the ballot box. Against my instinct the reality of UK politics is that it can perhaps most fruitfully be seen as the old voting against the young. The pandemic might be viewed  as  an  example of the young making economic sacrifices to benefit the old (and being consistently pilloried by the press on behalf of their ageing readership and geriatric paymasters for engaging in low risk behaviour  eg. going to the beach ) the young will not be rewarded. It’s telling that Wales, where 16yr olds can vote in senedd elections, now have a Labour majority.

This is not about zoomers vs boomers or any other marketing dept nonsense like that, there are no hard boundaries. I guess maybe this is about people invested in the future ( naturally these will tend to be younger) vs those who are invested in holding on to the past.
