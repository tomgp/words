(written in github file editor on an ipad so apologies for even worse typing than usual. esp lack of captitals and punctuation)

it's been a  while

I've not got a new job yet, but thats ok, money isnt a worry with E working and the kids are at home from school for the forseeable future so in those terms timing is good.
 
i havent been online much because ive been teaching/ entertaining kids/ cooking etc most of the time and when i do go online i find the covid19 stuff panic inducing

ive been reading _The Moonstone_ which 170pages in seems much longer than it needs to be.

also i'm reading _Lord of the Rings_ to K which is a great book to read out loud, esp love the bits where i get to do Gandalf, basing my reading on Michael Horden from the 80s BBC radio adaptation

we did march boardgame night online, via zoom and this [online Codenames board](https://www.horsepaste.com). it worked better than i expected.

in my non childcare time i've been doing some coding, learning websockets mainly.

i wasn't a huge fan  of seasons 1&2  of _The Crown_  and  the third series is terrible,  doubling down  on the faults of the first 2

i  did  enjoy _picard_ to the end but  the revelation of the  big bad as chittering  space robot worms was disappointing i  felt the show deserved something more interesting

OK.
