Apart from reading a few books? I’m both cautiously excited and slightly wary about stuff getting back to normal, it feels like we’re on the downslope of the pandemic but I personally am not feeling so confident about mass social gatherings and people’s desire to go crazy when they’re allowed  back out in the world. This could be my natural ambivalence towards such things but there’s an element of; hold on 150,000 people have died, surely many needn’t have, the idea that things are going back to normal, _can_ go back to normal seems absurd and misguided. This isn’t just about the worry that we’re not quite far enough along on vaccination to stop another wave. The psychosocial impact of the last year or so is going to be long lived and often subtle.  
  
Also, fucking cars back on the road. It’s telling that all the rightwing Mayoral candidates (the idiot lawrence f\*x etc) are taking an anti-bikes pro-cars stance. In London at least this feels like a significant front in the post brexit culture wars. It’s troubling that the populist right seem to have had some success in framing people riding bikes as somehow representative of selfish work-shy elites whilst driving a £100,000 Range Rover is the purview of the hard-working tax-paying majority. Of course the fact that the people who use bikes for work, precariously employed Deliveroo couriers etc, might on average have darker skin tones than those clogging up the streets with tonnes of useless metal has nothing to to with it.   
  
Anyway, I designed a sticker
