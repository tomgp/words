More Crouch End drama! They've closed off Middle Lane, which runs between the park and the local primary school. It's a trial, an attempt to create a more livable, less polluted neighbourhood. This has caused some minor disruption (extra 10 minutes or so on journeys at rush hour) for motorists  who've been howling on social media all week. Of course the complaints on social media are all about how idling traffic is making the air bad, which it is of course, but that traffic was just making the air bad in other places before and these people presumably weren't complaining about it then. Because all the complainers are car drivers and they don't actually care about air pollution. (I'm not saying that's true of everyone who's ever driven a car, I've driven a car and I care about air pollution, but really there's no need to drive a car in London for 90% of people) 

So yeah, I don't have any sympathy with the complaints. They should shut off more roads. The only way to change behaviour on any kind of scale is to make the undesirable behaviour more inconvenient than the alternative. Everyone agrees that air pollution etc. is bad but a lot of people don't seem willing to accept any inconvenience to improve matters.

Feeling pretty strident today.

After going on the climate strike bike ride a couple of weeks back I was heartend by being in the presence of other people who didn't think banning private motor vehicles from central London was an extreme position but rather a necessary starting point. Then I listened to <a href="https://cosmicshambles.com/bookshambles/stewart-lee-returns-again">Stewart Lee on the bookshambles podcast</a> and he said a similar thing of his brexit columns that he wrote for the guardian; he doesn't expect to change anybody's mind but it helps to bolster people to know that they're not alone inspite of the bullshit pro-brexit stance of like 80% of our press.

Oops, fell into writing about brexit. Sorry. I've decided to allow myself local politics and bit of environmental stuff here (focussing around positive action hopefully) but brexit really does infect it all. A real poison to the discourse.

OK, so what books did I finish that prompted me to post. 

1 _Their Brilliant Careers_ by Ryan O'Neil, which is 16 short biograpies of Australian writers, the twist being they're all imaginary. Each piece on it's own is entertaining enough (though they lack the manic invention of something like Lint, the ne-plus-ultra of imaginary literary biogs) but the real joy is the meta narrative which is woven through the individual stories involving the relationship of the author to one of his subjects and which is only revealed right at the end of the index, the key entry from which is skilfuly signposted in the acknowledgements, which then sends you back through the book picking up clues. Smart.

2 _BTW_ by Jarrett Kobek. A slim early novel (2013 I think) featuring some of the charaters from his later books. I enjoyed this, I enjoy Kobeks prose and I like his characters (though he doesn't here have the chops in developing character motivation which he displays in eg. _The Future Won't Be Long_ whihc leads to some narrative gear grinding... of course in _Only Americans..._ this is transmuted into a virtue) highlights in this one for me are the far-out readings of victorian novels. I'm a fan of victorian novels and far out readings.
