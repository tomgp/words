I’m sure I’ve mentioned before that I love Kelly Link so I was always going to love _Get In Trouble_ -- though I expect I'll never again feel the thrill of discovery I got from _Magic For Beginners_ after I picked it up on a whim, knowing pretty much nothing of its provenance. Her work is just so consistently amazing. In this her latest collection the stories mostly hover around the ghost story end of the genre spectrum but obviously it’s not that simple. There’s a noticeable shift in the way Link deals with the mundane –- without wishing to spoil anything, in these stories it’s often the everyday which is more uncanny or disturbing than the supernatural, the prospect of a baby born prematurely is more frightening than the fact that your hotel room might be home to a giant savagely clawed rodent. Of course this has always been present in her work but _Get In Trouble_ really goes all in. 

Recommended.
