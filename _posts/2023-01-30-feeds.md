Interrupting the scheduled silence: I have been on Mastodon for years but with the recent influx of newcomers it's become interesting enough that I've found my self actually visiting the "site"*. It's certainly less bad than Twitter but it does have the same vibe of something of a format that feels played out; the endless scroll. There must be better ways of relating online, there _are_ better ways of relating online: message boards discord servers etc. all offer a more rewarding experience for people interested in connecting rather than broadcasting. and from a consumption point of view specialist sites, blogs, and newsletters do a better job. I suspect Twitter was already circling the plughole before Musk started dicking around with it but he's certainly accelerated the spiral.

\* in quotes because I know it's not technically a single site
