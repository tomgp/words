A poem that feels particularly relevant this year — which feels like it’s been a mediocre failure in service of a return to a dysfunctional normal. Good riddance!

> Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,  
> The flying cloud, the frosty light;  
> The year is dying in the night;  
> Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.
>
> Ring out the old, ring in the new,  
> Ring, happy bells, across the snow:  
> The year is going, let him go;  
> Ring out the false, ring in the true.
>
> Ring out the grief that saps the mind,  
> For those that here we see no more,  
> Ring out the feud of rich and poor,  
> Ring in redress to all mankind.
>
> Ring out a slowly dying cause,  
> And ancient forms of party strife;  
> Ring in the nobler modes of life,  
> With sweeter manners, purer laws.
>
> Ring out the want, the care the sin,  
> The faithless coldness of the times;  
> Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes,  
> But ring the fuller minstrel in.
>
> Ring out false pride in place and blood,  
> The civic slander and the spite;  
> Ring in the love of truth and right,  
> Ring in the common love of good.
>
> Ring out old shapes of foul disease,  
> Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;  
> Ring out the thousand wars of old,  
> Ring in the thousand years of peace.
>
> Ring in the valiant man and free,  
> The larger heart, the kindlier hand;  
> Ring out the darkness of the land,  
> Ring in the Christ that is to be.

(Alfred, Lord Tennyson)
