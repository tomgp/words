I turned 41 a couple of weeks ago; replenished my reading stack through generous presents from friends and family and I bought myself a new board game _Brass: Birmingham_ and a [Laura Callaghan](https://www.lauracallaghanillustration.com) print which I took to get framed on Saturday morning.

Went to see New Order at Alexandra Palace. It was a good gig save for the encore which was three Joy Division tracks --  not why I go an see New Order but I guess they're part of the rock heritage circuit these days so it sort of  makes sense.

Went to see Wales playing rugby against Tonga in Cardiff with my dad for his 70th birthday. It was good, I much prefer watching live rugby to football, the atmosphere is more family friendly and the games are shorter. Also, having played rugby at a reasonable level at school I get what's going on, I can read the game in a way that I just don't really with football. Resisted the urge to buy cheap match scarves.

Finished _The Spire_ -- recommended! Started _Pet Sematary_; those 80s Stephen King books, [the covers](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/stephenking/images/a/a5/Pet_Sematary.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120212181346) esp. hold a special place in my imagination. If I was planning new editions I would go full on retro 80's VHS case.
