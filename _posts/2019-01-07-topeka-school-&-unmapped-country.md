I managed to finish one last book in 2019. Well, technically it was 2020 but I hadn't been to sleep yet so...

Anyway, the Topeka School. About author stand in Adam Gordon negotiating adolescence and toxic masculinity in the mid-west durting the 1990s. I liked it, and there were a couple of passages I really liked. There's one bit where Jane, the main characters mother, describes the feeling of not having booked a flight she was supposed to have booked but having fooled herself into believing she had until the last minute when her brain is forced to confront it's own deception. As a chronic procrastinator prone to anxiety I felt that was very well observed.

The book is clearly in dialogue with Infinite Jest which was published around the time the book is set and shares its concerns with masculinity, language, communication etc. There's also something about how both books deal with religion and/or religion stand-ins but I haven't had the capacity to unpack all that. 

My one dissapointment is that the book wasn't very funny, or i didn't find it to be anyway. I think it wanted to be and there are gestures in the direction of jokes but nothing really payed off.

I also finished a book of Ann Quin shorts and unfinished fragments that I bought solely on the strength of the cover upon which my mother's friend was quoted prominently. Inevitably, and as I expected it was a mixed bag but the high points were good enough I plan to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berg_(novel)">Berg</a> sometime soon.

Other news? Not much. I got a copy of two player Normany invasion battle game <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10630/memoir-44">Memoir '44</a>. I think it's an excellent design but I find the theme difficult. I just can't bring myself to try to win when playing as the Axis powers and it's pretty sobering to see your plasting guys removed from play and stacked up on the side of the board as you fight for control for an actual named bridge in the north of France as so many _actual_, non plastic people of my grandparents generation would have had to. Mind you I had to stop reading a Second World War Horrible Histories to my kids the other day as I found it too upsetting so maybe I'm over-sensitive?

Memoir 44 rules but with a Roman Empire theme would be right up my street.
