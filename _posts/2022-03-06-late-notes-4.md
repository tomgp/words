In actually writing this on Sunday, but I think I missed a week.

Is spring here? maybe.

* The Last Duel was a tough watch but solidly put  together, there were some interesting things about it.(not interesting enough for me to write them out though apparently)
* I finished painting a set of Mansions of Madness minis for Scott
* Played a game of Brass: Birmingham (just the canal phase) i hadn’t  taught it for a while so was a bit rusty on the best way to do so but we got there in the end.
* Played a game of Warcry. As others have pointed out, the toughness attribute seems over valued by the points system. Additionally the objectives can just leave one team without much hope— good luck chasing a quicker team or dislodging a gang of heavies who have chosen the objective locations. None of these things are beyond fixing, but the latter in particular seems like a lack of care and play testing. Also the rule book is a mess, you could teach the game in a couple of pages of writing and couple of pages of tables yet it’s spread through two 100+ page volumes with no indexes.
