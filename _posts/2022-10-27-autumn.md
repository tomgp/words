Been playing _Marvel Snap_ for the last week. The core game is fun (basically [Air, Land and Sea](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/247367/air-land-sea) but with more variety and less tightness, more of a video game) but the amount of mobile game bullshit you have to wade through to get to it! It's a shame that there doesn't seem to be a market for non-exploitative online card games. Like I'd happily pay a subscription of a couple of quid a month if I didn't have to work out what all the different currencies are for and grind through a progress track unlocking "shiny" card titles and other junk in order to get new cards.

I've been reading _Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell_ to K- over the last while. We're about half way through. It's really great, and fun to read out loud (I think I'm getting pretty good at reading out lound). Interesting particularly in the light of Vanity fair which is similar thickness and similar time scale. I wonder if ther are interesting comparisons to be drawn between Becky and Amelia/ Strange and Norell? Frenemies in the time of Napoleon. With J- we're working through the _Chronicles of Prydain_ I feel like between the children I've just about completed the children's fantasy cannon ( as hinted by Le Guin in _Cheek by Jowl_ ). Only _The Dark is Rising_ remains unbroached.

Also, I'm only half way though, but the most recent Alison Bechdel book _The Secret to Superhuman Strength_ is fantastic. Wierdly, a reading exprience most similar to watching a prime era Jonathan Meades documentary.

After all the events of the past few years it feel like I'm finaly getting used to having a social life of sorts again. Going to the pub, gigs etc. and I've been playing boardgames at [The Rogues Quarter](https://www.roguesquarter.com/) on most Monday evenings since the summer.

Having children continues to be a source of unalloyed joy and a real, ever evolving challenge.

Having parents has recently proved psychologically challenging.

Would it be too much to post 4 times a year? Season notes?

Oh, on the subject of seasons: Season 1 of For all Mankind, and did I ever mention The Expanse? Really liked that one. Basically space stuff, that's my thing, espescially if it involves some office politics.

On the subject of offices: I have a [new job](https://www.carbonbrief.org/about-us/) and I've also been doing some [freelance stuff](https://www.2x2.graphics/).
