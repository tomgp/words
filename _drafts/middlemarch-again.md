The [BBCs 1994 adaptation of Middlemarch](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00tckx3) has been on iPlayer for the last while and we watched the first episode the other night. I didn't watch the end as I had to help a child get to sleep but I don't feel the urge to watch further episodes. The whole thing just felt wrong, not my Middlemarch. Dorothea started off too sympathetic and her sister too shallow, it felt cartoonish. I did like the relationship between Mr. Farebrother and Lydgate.

But anyway. 

Yesterday morning when I got into work my colleague had _Slacked_ me. We'd vaguely arranged to work through something she was stuck on with [D3](https://d3js.org/) but I hadn't yet found the time & as it turned out some judicious googling had found at least some of the answer she was looking for. Strangely, the page she'd found helpful [was one I'd put together 5, nearly 6 years ago](http://bl.ocks.org/tomgp/a2e0ba749c5743b36fbe). It felt good that something I'd made had been helpful even in a small way. I like [answering Stack Overflow questions]() for the same reason.

What does this have to do with Middlemarch? Well it made me think of the the closing paragraph...

> \[Dorothea's\] finely touched spirit had still its fine issues, though they were not widely visible. Her full nature, like that river of which Cyrus broke the strength, spent itself in channels which had no great name on the earth. But the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.

Making small helpful web pages, answering questions for strangers, unhistoric acts for the growing good of the internet. Rewarding things to do though they won't make you rich or famous.
